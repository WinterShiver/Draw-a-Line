# Draw-a-Line

Drawing algorithm implementation with: 
* User-defined Parameter and its Input (implemention based on PyQt5)
* Point-by-Point Drawing Display (implemention based on Matplotlib)

## Drawing Algorithm Avaliable

* Line: DDA, Bresenham
* Circle, Ellipse: Mid-Point

## Something to say

This is my final project on the course Computer Graphics, and for someone is willing to browse it, it is posted online.
