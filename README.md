# Draw-a-Line

Drawing algorithm implementation with: 
* User-defined Parameter and its Input (implemention based on PyQt5)
* Point-by-Point Drawing Display (implemention based on Matplotlib)

## Drawing Algorithm Avaliable

* Line: DDA, Bresenham
* Circle, Ellipse: Mid-Point

## Something to say

This is my final project on the course Computer Graphics, and for someone is willing to browse it, it is posted online. More details could be seen via [DDA、Bresenham直线画线算法，中点圆、中点椭圆算法&可视化（Python3实现）](https://blog.csdn.net/WinterShiver/article/details/86757733).
